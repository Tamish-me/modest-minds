# modest-minds
This is a little website I’m building — part journal, part venting space, part digital sanctuary. I’m just using plain HTML and CSS for now, keeping it simple. No crazy frameworks, no distractions.  I wanted a quiet place online where I could write about things that matter to me — faith, feelings, thoughts that can't reach conversations.
